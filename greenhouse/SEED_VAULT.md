### 0. Proof of Work (PoW) - Visual History Heatmap
**Status:** 🌻 Bloomed (Deployed Jan 31, 2026)
**Complexity:** Medium
**Cypherpunk Factor:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡

**The Vision:**
A GitHub-style contributions graph showing the visual history of NostrGardn — a heatmap of daily photo activity over time. Each square represents a day; color intensity shows how many photos were taken. Visitors can browse different years, hover for counts, and click to see all photos from that specific day. It's proof-of-work made visible: the sweat equity in growing the garden, quantified and celebrated.

**How It Works:**
1. **Main Page (`/pow`)** — GitHub-style heatmap
   - Year selector dropdown (2018–2026)
   - 52-week × 7-day grid (rows = weekdays, columns = weeks)
   - Color intensity buckets: 0 (transparent), 1–2, 3–5, 6–8, 9+ photos
   - Hover tooltip shows photo count for that day
   - Click to navigate to day view

2. **Day View (`/pow/[year]/[month]/[day]`)** — Photo archive
   - Card grid showing all photos from that day (600px)
   - Lightbox for viewing full gallery images (1200px)
   - Space for optional diary entry (text-based reflection on the day)
   - Technical metadata: camera, ISO, aperture, shutter speed (if available)

**Garden-Themed Color Palette:**
- 0 photos: Transparent (unclickable)
- 1–2: #D4E8D4 Light sage (seedling stage)
- 3–5: #7DB77D Medium forest green (growing)
- 6–8: #2D5F2D Deep garden green (established)
- 9+: #E89B9B Blooming pink/mauve (celebrated!)

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Frontend:** SvelteKit routes + interactive heatmap component
- **Data:** Pre-generated `pow-metadata.json` (dates, EXIF specs, photo counts)
- **Diary Storage:** JSON file `pow-diaries.json` (for manual diary entries)
- **Privacy:** GPS location data stripped from all served images
- **Date Source:** Extracted from filenames (IMG_YYYYMMDD_####.jpeg), validated against EXIF DateTimeOriginal
- **Performance:** Single year's data loaded at a time (lazy-load other years)

**Current Status (Jan 31, 2026):**
- ✅ Metadata generation script complete (`generate_pow_metadata.py`)
- ✅ GPS stripping implemented (3,066 files processed)
- ✅ Metadata JSON files generated (pow-metadata.json, pow-diaries.json)
- ✅ Production GPS stripping plan documented (exiftool deployment approach)
- ✅ SvelteKit routes (`/pow`, `/pow/[year]/[month]/[day]`)
- ✅ Heatmap visualization component
- ✅ Lightbox gallery integration
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness
- ✅ Deployed to production at nostrgardn.com/pow

**Files Created:**
- `/scripts/generate_pow_metadata.py` — Metadata generator + GPS stripper
- `/docs/POW_GPS_STRIPPING_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` — Production privacy protocol
- `/build/public/data/pow-metadata.json` — Indexed image metadata
- `/build/public/data/pow-diaries.json` — Diary entry template

**Why It's Great:**
This is the **visual proof of labor** — a celebration of consistency and care. The heatmap shows the invisible work of gardening: days of many photos represent prolific planting/harvesting; gaps show seasons of rest. It's documentation without surveillance, a calendar of seasons without centralized control. Every gardener can fork this concept for their own projects.

**Future Extensions:**
- Lighting conditions heatmap (ISO/exposure analysis)
- Equipment evolution timeline (iPhone model distribution)
- Seasonal patterns visualization
- Export functionality (download heatmap data, archive photos)
- Integration with diary entries for AI-powered photo summaries

### 0.1. Feed-to-Gallery Deep Linking
**Status:** 🌰 Seed
**Complexity:** Medium
**Cypherpunk Factor:** ⚡⚡⚡

**The Vision:**
Transform the Feed from a standalone experience into a discovery mechanism that links to the permanent PoW gallery. When users click an image in the Feed (served by relays), instead of just opening it larger, match it to its corresponding hosted image and navigate to that day's PoW lightbox page.

**How It Works:**
1. **Parse image URL** from Nostr event (e.g., `https://image.nostr.build/abc123/IMG_20230809_0456.jpg`)
2. **Extract matching data:**
   - Trailing 4 digits from filename → `0456`
   - Date from filename pattern `IMG_YYYYMMDD_####` → `20230809`
   - Or fallback to Nostr event `created_at` timestamp
3. **Construct expected filename** → `IMG_20230809_0456.jpg`
4. **Check PoW metadata** to verify that date exists in the gallery
5. **Navigate to** `/pow/2023/08/09` (and optionally scroll/highlight that specific image)
6. **Fallback:** If no match found, open in current lightbox behavior

**UX Enhancements:**
- **Visual indicator** in Feed: subtle badge/icon on images that have matching PoW entries (shows they're "deeplinks")
- **Smooth transition:** animate from Feed → PoW day view
- **Graceful fallback:** "This image isn't in the garden yet" message for non-matches
- **Optional:** Show a breadcrumb trail (Feed → PoW → Day)

**Edge Cases to Handle:**
- Feed images from external hosts (nostr.build, etc.) with recognizable filenames
- Date mismatches (Nostr post date ≠ photo date)
- Images in Feed that aren't in the hosted gallery (user posts new content)
- Multiple images with same date/sequence number (unlikely but possible)

**Technical Notes:**
- Regex for filename parsing: `/IMG_(\d{8})_(\d{4})\.\w+$/`
- Client-side matching against existing `pow-metadata.json`
- URL parsing to extract filename from various image hosts
- Consider caching match results for performance

**Why It's Great:**
Creates a cohesive user journey across NostrGardn's three image contexts (main page, Feed, PoW). The Feed becomes a window into the curated gallery, not a separate silo. Very cypherpunk: decentralized discovery (Nostr) leading to permanent cultivation (hosted PoW). All roads lead to the garden.

### 0.2. Main Page Image Curation System
**Status:** 🌰 Seed
**Complexity:** Medium
**Cypherpunk Factor:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡

**The Vision:**
Replace the static 4-image showcase on the main page with a dynamic, Nostr-powered curation system. Use Nostr event tags to mark images as "featured," keeping curation on-chain and manageable from any Nostr client.

**How It Works:**
1. **Nostr Tag-Based Selection:**
   - Custom tag like `["featured", "home"]` or `["garden-display", "main"]`
   - Or rating system: `["rating", "5"]` for favorites
   - Or seasonal: `["season", "spring"]` for themed displays

2. **Dynamic Fetching:**
   - Query relays for events with the featured tag
   - Pull 4 random images from the pool (or rotation logic)
   - Refresh on page load or interval

3. **Curation Interface (Future):**
   - Admin route (`/curate`) for Master Gardener to tag images
   - Or manage directly from Nostr client (Damus, Primal, etc.)
   - Could allow Gardeners to vote/propose featured images

**Display Options:**
- **Random 4** from featured pool (current behavior, but dynamic)
- **Rotation** - cycle through featured images on timer
- **Seasonal** - filter by season tag
- **Most zapped** - show highest-zapped featured images
- **Recent additions** - show newly featured content

**Technical Notes:**
- Fetch Nostr events with custom tag filter
- Parse image URLs from events
- Cache featured image list client-side
- Could pre-generate featured pool in metadata JSON for performance
- Master Gardener npub has curation authority

**Why It's Great:**
Keeps the curation **on-chain** - manage featured images from anywhere, not just the website. Scales beyond 4 static images without manual code updates. Could enable community curation (Gardener voting). Very decentralized: the garden's front door is managed by the protocol, not a CMS.

**Future Extensions:**
- Community voting on featured images
- Seasonal/thematic collections
- "Image of the Week" spotlight
- Export featured collection as Nostr list (NIP-51)

### 1. Proof of Photosynthesis Verification Badge
**Status:** 🌰 Seed
**Complexity:** Medium
**Cypherpunk Factor:** ⚡⚡⚡

**The Vision:**
Forget the blue checkmark industrial complex. In the garden, trust is earned through sunlight and community engagement. Posts from Gardeners receive a living verification badge — a tiny seedling (🌱) that *grows* based on how much the community waters it with zaps.

**How It Works:**
- **0–20 zaps:** 🌱 Seedling — humble beginnings
- **21–68 zaps:** 🌳 Sapling — taking root in the community
- **69+ zaps:** 🌺 Full Bloom — with celebratory particle effects (petals falling, maybe some sparkles, you know the drill)

**Technical Notes:**
- Requires tracking zap events (NIP-57) per post
- Badge state could be computed client-side or cached
- Particle effects via CSS animations or a lightweight library
- The number 21 references Bitcoin's 21M cap; 69 is... well, you know

**Why It's Great:**
This is your trust layer — but *botanical*. It gamifies engagement without the toxicity of follower counts. A post with a blooming flower is a post the community has blessed. It's proof-of-work, but the work is *touching grass*.

### 2. The Relay Greenhouse Dashboard
**Status:** 🌰 Seed
**Complexity:** Medium-High
**Cypherpunk Factor:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡

**The Vision:**
A `/greenhouse` route that visualizes connected Nostr relays as potted plants in a digital conservatory. Each relay is a living organism — healthy connections are lush and green; flaky relays wilt dramatically and shed pixelated leaves.

**Relay-to-Plant Mapping (Examples):**
| Relay | Plant | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| relay.damus.io | 🌻 Sunflower | Bright, popular, faces the sun |
| nos.lol | 🌵 Cactus | Resilient, low-maintenance |
| relay.primal.net | 🌿 Fern | Steady, dependable, prehistoric vibes |
| purplepag.es | 🍇 Grapevine | Aggregates information, spreads widely |
| (flaky relay) | 🥀 Wilting rose | Connection issues = drought |

**Interactive Features:**
- Click a plant to see its stats: uptime, message throughput (visualized as "water droplets"), latency
- Hover to see the last successful ping
- Drag to rearrange your greenhouse layout
- Mute/unmute relays by putting them "in the shade"

**Technical Notes:**
- WebSocket connection health monitoring
- SVG or Canvas-based plant rendering
- Local storage for layout preferences
- Could integrate with existing NDK connection events

**Why It's Great:**
Relay infrastructure is invisible to most users, which is a shame because it's the actual decentralized backbone. This makes the protocol *tangible* — suddenly you care about relay health because your sunflower is drooping. Also, it's just delightful.

### 3. Seed Bomb Guest Posting (The Compost Heap)
**Status:** 🌱 Seedling
**Complexity:** High
**Cypherpunk Factor:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡

**The Vision:**
Non-whitelisted users (plebs) who don't use the required `#nostrgardnpost` tag don't just get rejected — they get composted. Their post lands in **The Compost Heap**, a quarantine section where the community decides its fate.

**The Lifecycle of a Seed Bomb:**
1. **Pleb posts without proper tag** → Post enters Compost Heap
2. **24-hour window** → Gardeners can upvote ("water") or downvote ("weed")
3. **If watered enough** → Post "blooms" and migrates to the main feed
4. **If ignored/weeded** → Post decomposes (deleted after 7 days)

**Governance Model:**
- Only Gardeners can vote (Master Gardener vote counts 3x? TBD)
- Threshold for blooming: e.g., 5 net upvotes within 24 hours
- Anti-spam: each pleb gets max 1 seed bomb per day

**UI Concept:**
- `/compost` route with a earthy brown aesthetic
- Posts displayed in a pile-like layout, newest on top
- "Water" and "Weed" buttons with satisfying animations
- Countdown timer showing time until decomposition

**Technical Notes:**
- Requires local or relay-based storage for vote tracking
- Could use NIP-25 reactions for voting
- Bloom migration = re-tag event? Or just allow in filter?
- Rate limiting by pubkey

**Why It's Great:**
This is decentralized content moderation that actually feels *fun*. It's natural selection for posts. Good content rises; spam decomposes. The community tends the garden together. Plus, "Compost Heap" is just a great name.

### 4. Encrypted Garden Gnome DMs
**Status:** 🌰 Seed
**Complexity:** Medium
**Cypherpunk Factor:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡

**The Vision:**
Every Gardener's profile gets a tiny garden gnome icon (🧙‍♂️). Click it to send them an NIP-04 encrypted direct message. The gnome *winks* when you receive one. Because nothing says "private, censorship-resistant communication" like a ceramic yard ornament guarding your secrets.

**Gnome States:**
| State | Appearance | Meaning |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Idle | 🧙‍♂️ Standing still | No new messages |
| Winking | 🧙‍♂️💬 Animated wink | Unread DM waiting |
| Sleeping | 🧙‍♂️💤 | DMs disabled (do not disturb) |
| Golden | 🧙‍♂️✨ | Master Gardener's gnome |

**Features:**
- Click gnome → Opens DM compose modal
- Gnome wink persists until messages are read
- Optional: gnome can hold a sign with your NIP-05 verification
- Sound effect on message receive (subtle wind chimes?)

**Technical Notes:**
- NIP-04 encryption (or NIP-44 for better security)
- Store unread state locally or derive from relay
- Gnome rendering via SVG with CSS animations
- Could extend to group DMs (a gnome *council*?)

**Why It's Great:**
DMs are a core protocol feature but most clients treat them as an afterthought. The gnome makes private messaging *whimsical*. It's memorable. "Send me a gnome" could become actual slang. Plus, gnomes are inherently cypherpunk — they guard things silently, ask no questions, and have been around since before the internet.

### 5. Touch Grass Mode
**Status:** 🌱 Seedling
**Complexity:** Low
**Cypherpunk Factor:** ⚡⚡ (self-sovereignty over your attention)

**The Vision:**
A client-side setting that, when enabled, pauses the feed after a configurable duration (default: 15 minutes) and displays a gentle but firm message:

> *"The garden will still be here. Go outside."*

A sundial-style countdown timer shows when the lockout expires (or allows immediate override with a "I touched grass" button that requires solving a simple nature-themed captcha).

**Lockout Screen Features:**
- Sundial animation showing time remaining
- Random nature fact or quote
- Photo from the garden (user's own #gardn posts if available)
- "I touched grass" override button
- Captcha examples: "Select all images with flowers" / "What color is grass?"

**Settings:**
- Enable/disable Touch Grass Mode
- Set duration before lockout (5/15/30/60 min)
- Set lockout duration (5/15/30 min)
- Hardcore mode: no override button

**Technical Notes:**
- Pure client-side implementation
- localStorage for preferences and session tracking
- Service worker for lockout enforcement (optional)
- No server component needed

**Why It's Great:**
Peak dad energy. Peak self-care. Peak cypherpunk (you control your own attention). The attention economy is a vampire; this is garlic. Also, "Touch Grass Mode" is infinitely meme-able.

### 6. Lightning-Powered Watering Can (Zaps-to-Tips)
**Status:** 🌱 Seedling
**Complexity:** Medium
**Cypherpunk Factor:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡

**The Vision:**
The zap button, reimagined as a watering can. When you zap a post, rain animation falls gently on the image. The more sats you send, the heavier the rain. Hit 21,000 sats and you trigger a full thunderstorm with ASCII lightning bolts.

**Zap Tiers:**
| Sats | Animation | Sound (optional) |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| 1–99 | 💧 Light drizzle | Soft patter |
| 100–999 | 🌧️ Steady rain | Rain sounds |
| 1,000–9,999 | ⛈️ Heavy rain + puddles | Heavier rain |
| 10,000–20,999 | 🌊 Downpour + flooding effect | Thunder rumble |
| 21,000+ | ⚡ THUNDERSTORM | Full ASCII lightning, screen flash |

**Interactive Details:**
- Watering can icon tilts when clicked
- Water pours from can to post in arc animation
- Rain accumulates briefly on the image (CSS filter)
- Thunderstorm triggers confetti-style lightning bolts
- Post "glistens" after being watered

**Technical Notes:**
- NIP-57 zap integration
- CSS animations for rain effects
- Canvas or SVG for lightning
- Zap amount detection from event
- Could cache recent zap totals per post

**Why It's Great:**
Bitcoin's smallest unit meets the garden metaphor perfectly. You're not just tipping — you're *watering* the garden. The creator gets sats; the post gets nourished. The thunderstorm at 21K is a flex and a celebration. This makes zapping *theatrical*.

### 7. NIP-05 Botanical Classification
**Status:** 🌰 Seed
**Complexity:** Low-Medium
**Cypherpunk Factor:** ⚡⚡⚡

**The Vision:**
Instead of displaying boring email-style NIP-05 verification (`vic@nostrgardn.com`), we classify Gardeners like botanical specimens:

> **Genus:** *Victorius californicus*
> **Family:** Gardenaceae
> **Native to:** nostrgardn.com

This displays as a museum-style placard next to their posts — scientific, absurd, and deeply memorable.

**Classification Rules:**
- **Genus:** Derived from display name (Latinized)
- **Species:** Derived from location or domain (californicus, tokyoensis, etc.)
- **Family:** All garden members are Gardenaceae
- **Native to:** The NIP-05 domain

**Examples:**
| User | NIP-05 | Botanical Name |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Victor | _@agilecoffee.com | *Victorius coffeensis* |
| Hiromi | _@nostrgardn.com | *Hiromia gardensis* |
| stntstn | _@stationtostation.io | *Stationia transiticus* |

**Display:**
- Small card/tooltip on profile hover
- Optional: include a hand-drawn botanical illustration silhouette
- Master Gardener gets special designation: "Type Specimen"

**Technical Notes:**
- Parse NIP-05 and display name
- Simple Latinization rules (add -us/-ia suffix, etc.)
- Static or procedurally generated illustrations
- Could be a fun onboarding moment ("You've been classified!")

**Why It's Great:**
Identity on Nostr is already pseudonymous and playful. This leans into that fully. It makes verification feel like being catalogued in a 19th-century botanical expedition. It's memorable, shareable, and deeply weird in the best way.

---

### 8. Fork the Garden (Export Button)
**Status:** 🌱 Seedling
**Complexity:** Low
**Cypherpunk Factor:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ (MAXIMUM)

**The Vision:**
True to cypherpunk ethos: if you can't export it, you don't own it. A prominent button labeled **"Fork the Garden 🍴"** lets any user export the entire current feed as:

- JSON blob (raw Nostr events)
- Markdown archive (human-readable)
- IPFS-pinned snapshot (optional, for permanence)

**Export Options:**
| Format | Contents | Use Case |
|--------|----------|----------|
| JSON | Raw NDK events, all metadata | Backup, migration, analysis |
| Markdown | Posts with images as links, author info | Reading, archiving |
| HTML | Standalone webpage snapshot | Offline viewing |
| IPFS | Pinned JSON + images | Permanent decentralized archive |

**Button Behavior:**
- Click → Modal with export options
- Progress bar during export
- Download or copy to clipboard
- IPFS option shows CID after pinning

**Philosophical Statement (shown in modal):**
> *"The garden belongs to everyone who tends it. Take these seeds wherever you go."*

**Technical Notes:**
- JSON export is trivial (serialize current posts array)
- Markdown generation with image URL preservation
- IPFS integration via web3.storage or Pinata API
- Could include export of user's own posts only

**Why It's Great:**
This is the ultimate flex against platform capture. "We're so confident in our value that we'll help you leave." It signals that nostrgardn is not a walled garden — it's a *commons*. Data portability isn't a feature; it's a *philosophy*.

---

## FUTURE SEEDS (Not Yet Defined)

These are raw ideas mentioned in passing that deserve future exploration:

- **AI Image Filtering:** Automatic nature-themed classification (already stubbed in config.ts)
- **Private Relay (gardn.nostr1.com):** Gardener-only relay for faster sync
- **Seasonal Themes:** UI changes based on real-world season (cherry blossoms in spring, etc.)
- **Gardener Leaderboard:** Most prolific planters, most zapped, etc.
- **Cross-Garden Pollination:** Federation with other nostr-based communities
- **Garden Plot NFTs:** Joke? Maybe? Probably not. Unless...?
